name: ctl-handoff
description: "Compact the current task/session context into a portable handoff another agent or human can safely pick up: task, phase, objective, decisions, modified files, gates run, open uncertainties, next safe action, do-not-do list, environment hazards, adapter/platform, and whether a dispatch binding (CTL_TASK_ID) is active. Triggers when: the session is long, context is high, switching agents/platforms, before AFK, or before a separate governed run. Do NOT trigger for: a quick in-session continuation."

# ctl-handoff (Claude Code)

The **managed core** below is the platform-neutral ctl workflow protocol, byte-checked by CI against `.agent/protocols/workflow-skills.md` across platforms. Do not edit it here — it is generated from `.agent/skills/ctl-handoff/source.md` by `ctl skills sync`. Claude Code-specific mechanics live after the core.

# ctl Workflow Skills — Core Protocol

WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1

This is the platform-neutral workflow-skills core. It is embedded **verbatim**
inside every ctl workflow skill's managed-core block; the canonical copy lives at
`.agent/protocols/workflow-skills.md`. A CI drift check fails if any copy (or its
declared version) diverges. Edit this file and re-sync every workflow skill
together — never one in isolation. Nothing platform-specific (tool names, hook
mechanics, plugin paths) and nothing phase-specific belongs here; that lives in
each skill outside the managed core.

## Division of labor (non-negotiable)

Skills and agents manage **semantic workflow** — what to think about, in what
order, and which artifact each phase produces. ctl manages **facts, scope,
evidence, gates, ledgers, and honest disclosure**. A workflow skill never relaxes
a boundary, never declares a task complete, and never substitutes its own
judgement for ctl evidence. Workflow discipline is not proof: it does not replace
gates, audits, reviewer independence, or tamper evidence, and it never creates a
verdict.

## Phase map

Phases run in this order; skip any whose preconditions are already met. Each
phase is a separate skill that carries this same core plus its own body.

1. **grill / first principles** — before a PRD or implementation, when the
   request is ambiguous, too broad, high-risk, or likely to build the wrong
   thing. Output: alignment artifacts (observed facts, declared rules,
   assumptions, irreducible constraints, goals, non-goals, unknowns, a minimum
   viable experiment) — not a claim of truth.
2. **PRD** — after enough context is resolved and before generating multiple
   durable tasks. Draft until explicitly confirmed. Separate **ObservedBasis**
   (what the agent actually read) from **ConfirmedBasis** (what a user or project
   authority confirmed) from **OpenUncertainty** (unresolved unknowns, never
   hidden). Status is one of: draft · confirmed · superseded.
3. **tasks / issues** — vertical slices, each independently verifiable, each
   declaring objective, read scope, write scope, gates, acceptance evidence, and
   an **AFK / HITL** label and blocking uncertainties. Never bypass protected-path
   controls; never synthesize completed ctl events from a plan.
4. **TDD** — during implementation: one behavior at a time, red evidence before
   green evidence, refactor only after green. Test public behavior, not private
   implementation detail.
5. **diagnose / bayesian** — for bugs, flaky behavior, unexpected results, or
   architectural uncertainty. No fix before a red-capable feedback loop.
   Hypotheses must be falsifiable; prefer discriminating evidence over broad
   speculation.
6. **architecture review** — read-only by default; outputs candidates, not code
   changes. The user chooses which candidate becomes a new governed task.
7. **handoff** — when the session is long, context is high, when switching
   agents or platforms, or before AFK / starting a separate governed run.

## Thinking frameworks, placed

- **First Principles** belongs in grill / design clarification: restate the
  problem, separate observed facts from declared rules from assumptions, name the
  irreducible constraints, and challenge inherited ones — "are we doing this
  because the domain requires it, or because the existing architecture/framework
  suggests it?" Outputs are artifacts, not verdicts.
- **Bayesian reasoning** belongs in diagnose / loop-breaking: rank falsifiable
  hypotheses, grade evidence, update belief in plain language, and seek the
  discriminating test. Ranked hypotheses and evidence quality — not numeric
  confidence scoring.

Do not create floating, generic "think better" skills; the frameworks live
inside the phases above.

## Invariants every phase honors

- Produce **artifacts, not claims**. "Done" is an evidence artifact ctl can see,
  never an assertion — "where is the evidence?"
- Keep **draft separate from confirmed basis**; disclose open uncertainty rather
  than hiding it.
- **Red before green**: no green claim without prior red evidence for the same
  behavior.
- **No fix before a reproduction loop.**
- **Architecture review is read-only**; a refactor needs a fresh governed task.
- External workflow inspiration is **L0 reference material** (see Provenance) —
  never an authority, never vendored as an active control.

## Provenance

These workflow skills are ctl-native rewrites inspired by Matt Pocock's
engineering skill workflow and by the First Principles / Bayesian placement
introduced in Trellis PR #335. External skill text is treated as L0 reference
material; ctl does not vendor third-party skills as an active control plane and
does not place them inside its trust boundary.

## Handoff (phase body)

Start from the ledger-derived artifact, then layer on judgement:

```
ctl handoff export --id <task> [--json]
```

`ctl handoff export` is strictly read-only (appends nothing) and emits a
`control.handoff.v1` snapshot: objective + boundary, per-gate status, the
completion-interlock verdict, the drift-derived next action, the uncommitted files
inside the task's write scope, and the recent event tail.

### Add what the export can't know

The export gives facts; you add the **decisions and hazards**:

- **Current task / phase / objective** — from the export.
- **Decisions made** — and the reasoning, so they aren't relitigated.
- **Modified files** — the export lists uncommitted in-scope files; note *why*.
- **Gates run** — from the export's per-gate status.
- **Open uncertainties** — what is still unresolved (carry forward, don't bury).
- **Next safe action** — the single safest next step.
- **Do-not-do list** — dead ends, things tried, things explicitly out of scope.
- **Known local environment hazards** — OS quirks, stale binaries, flaky steps.
- **Adapter / platform used** — OMP, opencode, manual.
- **Dispatch binding** — whether `CTL_TASK_ID` (or equivalent) is active, so the
  next agent governs its calls by the right task.

### No active task?

If there is no active task, produce a conversation/project handoff **only** if a
safe in-scope location allows it; otherwise **print the handoff to stdout**. Never
invent a write target to place a handoff.

### Quality bar

- A fresh agent could resume without re-deriving the decisions.
- The do-not-do list captures the dead ends, not just the successes.
- Open uncertainties are disclosed, not smoothed over.
- The next safe action is a single concrete step.

### Anti-patterns

- ❌ A handoff that lists what was done but not what was decided or avoided.
- ❌ Hiding an unresolved uncertainty to look finished.
- ❌ Writing the handoff outside the active task's write scope.
- ❌ Omitting the active dispatch binding, so the next agent misbinds.

## Claude Code Integration (platform-specific)

`ctl handoff export` is read-only and always safe to run. Persist the enriched handoff to `.ctl/tasks/<task-id>/handoff.md` only if that path is in the active task's `write_allow`; otherwise print it. Note whether `CTL_TASK_ID` is set so the next Claude Code session binds to the right task (the `.claude/hooks/ctl-gate.py` gate reads it to resolve multi-active ambiguity).
